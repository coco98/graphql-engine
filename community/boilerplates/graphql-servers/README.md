# GraphQL Server Boilerplates

Hasura GraphQL Engine can combine schemas from multiple remote GraphQL servers
and expose them at a single endpoint. You can write these GraphQL servers in any
language and Hasura takes care of stitching together the schema from these
servers. 

This directory contains boilerplates for writing GraphQL servers using various
languages and frameworks.
