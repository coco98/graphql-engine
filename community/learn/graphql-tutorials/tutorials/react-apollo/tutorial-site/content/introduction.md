This tutorial is for React developers to learn what GraphQL is and how to use GraphQL in react applications. It is ideal if you follow along with code and should not take you more than a few hours to finish end to end.

You will be building a realtime todo app using authenticated GraphQL APIs.

Try this deployed version of the app to see what we'll be building:

We will be simulating a scenario where we already have a
GraphQL API and the basic UI of your react app built. Our task in this
scenario is to integrate the GraphQL APIs into our react app to build
a complete and working app.

You need to have npm/yarn & node 8+ running.

## How long will this tutorial take?
Less than 2 hours

## Who is this tutorial for?

React apps.
